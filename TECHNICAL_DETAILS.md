## Enhanced Grouping Confidence System (v2.2.0)

The enhanced grouping confidence system uses a weighted metric model to determine how likely files belong to the same audiobook. It combines multiple indicators with configurable weights and applies penalties for potential issues.

### Grouping Confidence Components

#### 1. Positive Indicators

* **Duration Consistency (0.4 weight)**:
  * Uses coefficient of variation (CV) of file durations
  * Normalized score: `1 / (1 + CV^2)`
  * Forgiving curve that allows for some natural variation
  * Most reliable when multiple files have similar durations

* **Naming Pattern Similarity (0.3 weight)**:
  * Compares filenames using Jaro-Winkler similarity
  * Looks for common patterns like numbering, chapter markers, etc.
  * Normalized score between 0.0 and 1.0

* **Title Similarity (0.3 weight)**:
  * Uses weighted Damerau-Levenshtein distance
  * Normalized and adjusted for string length
  * Accounts for common typos and variations

#### 2. Penalties

* **Mixed Audio Formats (0.8 penalty)**:
  * Very strong penalty when files have different audio formats
  * Mixed formats strongly suggest files are not from the same book
  * Applied as: `final_score *= (1 * penalty)`

* **Low Title Similarity (0.3 penalty)**:
  * Applied when average title similarity is below threshold
  * Helps catch mismatched files with similar durations

* **Suspicious File Count (0.2 penalty)**:
  * Applied when group size is unusually large
  * Helps prevent over-grouping of files

### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence Range | Color  | Status         | Metadata Source               |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| â‰¥ 0.70         | Green  | High Confidence | Use existing metadata        |
| 0.50 * 0.69    | Amber  | Medium Confidence | OpenLibrary or minimal metadata |
| < 0.50         | Red    | Low Confidence  | LLM enrichment required      |

### Configuration Options

All weights and penalties are configurable in `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
confidence:
  min_confidence: 0.60              # Minimum confidence for auto-grouping (chaptered)
  llm_threshold: 0.50               # Only use LLM if confidence is below this value

grouping_confidence:
  weights:
    duration_consistency: 0.4
    naming_pattern: 0.3
    title_similarity: 0.3

  penalties:
    mixed_formats: 0.8
    low_title_similarity: 0.3
    suspicious_file_count: 0.2

  thresholds:
    max_cv: 0.3         # Maximum allowed coefficient of variation in durations
    min_title_similarity: 0.7  # Minimum title similarity before penalty
    max_files_no_penalty: 10   # Max files before suspicious count penalty
```

## Enrichment Confidence Scoring

The enrichment confidence system employs a multi-algorithm approach to determine the similarity between strings, primarily used for matching and grouping related content. This system is crucial for making accurate decisions about which files belong together and when external metadata enrichment is necessary.

### Algorithm Overview

#### 1. Weighted Damerau-Levenshtein Distance

**Implementation Details:**

The weighted Damerau-Levenshtein distance is a string metric that measures the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions) needed to transform one string into another. Our implementation includes several key enhancements:

* Vowel-Specific Weights: Vowel substitutions (a, e, i, o, u) are penalized less (0.2) than consonant substitutions (1.0) to account for common mishearings and typos.
* Transposition Handling: Adjacent character transpositions receive a fixed penalty of 0.5, making the algorithm more forgiving of common typing errors.
* Normalization: The final distance is normalized by the maximum string length, resulting in a score between 0.0 (completely different) and 1.0 (identical).

**Mathematical Formulation:**

```python
# For strings a and b of lengths m and n respectively:
# Initialize DP matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1)
# Base cases: DP[i][0] = i, DP[0][j] = j

# Recurrence relation:
DP[i][j] = min(
    DP[i-1][j] + 1,                          # Deletion
    DP[i][j-1] + 1,                         # Insertion
    DP[i-1][j-1] + cost(a[i-1], b[j-1])    # Substitution
)

# Transposition case (i,j > 1 and a[i-1] == b[j-2] and a[i-2] == b[j-1])
if i > 1 and j > 1 and a[i-1] == b[j-2] and a[i-2] == b[j-1]:
    DP[i][j] = min(DP[i][j], DP[i-2][j-2] + 0.5)

def cost(c1, c2):
    if c1 == c2:
        return 0
    elif c1 in 'aeiou' and c2 in 'aeiou':
        return 0.2
    return 1.0
```

**Strengths:**

* Handles OCR errors and minor typos effectively
* Custom weights for different error types improve accuracy
* Particularly good for short to medium-length strings

**Limitations:**

* Time and space complexity of O(m*n) makes it expensive for very long strings
* May be too permissive for short strings where even small differences are significant
* Performance can degrade with very large character sets or Unicode-heavy text

#### 2. Jaro-Winkler with N-gram Penalty

**Implementation Details:**
This algorithm combines the Jaro-Winkler similarity metric with an n-gram based penalty:

1. **Jaro-Winkler Similarity:**
   * Computes the Jaro similarity, which counts matching characters within a sliding window
   * Applies a prefix scale (0.1) to the Jaro similarity, giving more weight to matching prefixes
   * Particularly effective for names and titles where the beginning is often more significant

2. **N-gram Penalty:**
   * Breaks strings into n-grams (default n=2)
   * Computes the Jaccard distance between n-gram sets
   * Applies a decay factor (0.1) to the Jaccard distance
   * Subtracts this penalty from the base Jaro-Winkler score

**Mathematical Formulation:**

```python
def jaro_winkler_ngram(a: str, b: str, n: int = 2) -> float:
    # Jaro-Winkler similarity
    jw = jaro_winkler_similarity(a, b)
    
    # Common prefix length (up to 4 characters)
    prefix_len = 0
    max_prefix = min(4, len(a), len(b))
    while prefix_len < max_prefix and a[prefix_len].lower() == b[prefix_len].lower():
        prefix_len += 1
    
    # Apply prefix scaling
    prefix_scale = 0.1
    jw += prefix_scale * prefix_len * (1 * jw)
    
    # N-gram penalty
    def get_ngrams(s, n):
        return {s[i:i+n].lower() for i in range(len(s)-n+1)} if len(s) >= n else {s.lower()}
    
    a_ngrams = get_ngrams(a, n)
    b_ngrams = get_ngrams(b, n)
    
    if not a_ngrams or not b_ngrams:
        return jw
    
    # Jaccard distance between n-gram sets
    intersection = len(a_ngrams & b_ngrams)
    union = len(a_ngrams | b_ngrams)
    ngram_penalty = 0.1 * (1 * intersection / union) if union > 0 else 0
    
    return max(jw * ngram_penalty, 0.0)
```

**Strengths:**

* Excellent for matching names and titles with minor variations
* Prefix weighting helps with common abbreviations and honorifics
* N-gram penalty reduces false positives by considering local context

**Limitations:**

* The n-gram penalty can be too harsh for very short strings
* May struggle with strings that have significant insertions/deletions
* Performance impact from n-gram generation for long strings

#### 3. Phonetic Similarity with Soundex and Damerau-Levenshtein

**Implementation Details:**
This hybrid approach combines phonetic matching with edit distance:

1. **Soundex Pre-filtering:**
   * Converts strings to their Soundex codes (a 4-character representation)
   * If Soundex codes match, applies a reduced penalty (0.5) to subsequent distance calculations
   * Particularly effective for catching names that sound similar but are spelled differently

2. **Normalized Damerau-Levenshtein Distance:**
   * Computes the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between the original strings
   * Normalizes the distance by the maximum string length
   * Applies the Soundex penalty if applicable

**Mathematical Formulation:**

```python
def phonetic_similarity(a: str, b: str) -> float:
    # Convert to lowercase and trim whitespace
    a = a.strip().lower()
    b = b.strip().lower()
    
    # Handle edge cases
    if not a and not b:
        return 1.0
    if not a or not b:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate Soundex codes
    soundex_a = soundex(a)
    soundex_b = soundex(b)
    
    # Apply penalty based on Soundex match
    penalty = 0.5 if soundex_a == soundex_b else 1.0
    
    # Calculate normalized Damerau-Levenshtein distance
    dl_distance = damerau_levenshtein_distance(a, b)
    max_len = max(len(a), len(b))
    normalized_dl = dl_distance / max_len if max_len > 0 else 0.0
    
    return 1.0 * (penalty * normalized_dl)
```

**Strengths:**

* Excellent for matching names with different spellings but similar pronunciation
* Handles common phonetic variations well
* The Soundex pre-filter provides a significant performance optimization

**Limitations:**

* Soundex is designed for English and may not work well with non-English names
* The binary nature of Soundex matching (match/no match) can be too coarse in some cases
* Less effective for short strings where phonetic similarity is less meaningful

### Combined Scoring Approach

The final confidence score is computed as the average of these three metrics, providing a robust measure of string similarity that accounts for different types of variations. This combined approach helps overcome the limitations of any single algorithm by leveraging their complementary strengths.

### Scoring Interpretation

| Score Range       | Confidence Level          | Description                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 0.9 * 1.0        | Very High Confidence     | Nearly identical strings                      |
| 0.7 * 0.89       | High Confidence          | Minor variations or typos                    |
| 0.5 * 0.69       | Moderate Confidence      | Some significant differences                 |
| 0.3 * 0.49       | Low Confidence           | Substantial differences                      |
| 0.0 * 0.29       | Very Low Confidence      | Likely different items                       |

### Performance Considerations

* **Case Insensitivity:** All string comparisons are case-insensitive to ensure consistent matching regardless of letter casing.
* **Whitespace Handling:** Leading and trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed before comparison to avoid false mismatches.
* **Edge Cases:** Empty strings are handled as a special case, always returning 0.0 similarity.
* **Caching:** LRU (Least Recently Used) caching with a size of 256 entries is implemented to improve performance for repeated comparisons.

### Key Factors

* Title/author matching between filename and folder names
* File count and size patterns
* Bitrate consistency across files
* Blacklist term matches
* OpenLibrary match quality (when available)

**Decision Flow**:

1. **High Confidence (â‰¥ confidence_threshold, default: 0.70)**:
   * Uses existing metadata without enrichment
   * Status: "Confident"
   * Color: Green in UI

2. **Medium Confidence (llm_threshold â‰¤ score < confidence_threshold)**:
   * Tries OpenLibrary mirror first (if enabled)
   * Falls back to minimal metadata if no good match
   * Status: "LowConfidence"
   * Color: Orange in UI
   * *No LLM calls made*

3. **Low Confidence (< llm_threshold, default: 0.50)**:
   * Added to batch queue for LLM enrichment
   * Processes in configurable batches (default: 5 at a time)
   * Status: "LLM" after enrichment
   * Color: Red in UI

**Configuration** (in settings.yaml):

```yaml
confidence:
  min_confidence: 0.70  # Skip enrichment if score >= this
  llm_threshold: 0.50    # Use LLM if score < this
openlibrary:
  use_local_mirror: true  # Try local mirror first
  mirror_db: "./ol_mirror.sqlite"
llm_batch_size: 5  # Batch size for LLM enrichment
```

### 7.3 UI Integration

**Color Coding**:

* **Green (â‰¥ 0.70)**: High confidence * using existing metadata
* **Orange (0.50-0.69)**: Medium confidence * using OpenLibrary or minimal metadata
* **Red (< 0.50)**: Low confidence * using LLM enrichment

**Display Columns**:

* **Type**: Shows "Chaptered" (grouping confidence â‰¥ 0.6) or "Monolithic"
* **Conf**: Displays the enrichment confidence score (0.00-1.00)
* **Status**: Indicates source of metadata (Confident/LowConfidence/LLM)

**Visual Hierarchy**:

* Book entries are expandable to show individual files
* Confidence colors are applied to the entire book row
* Files within a chaptered book inherit the parent's confidence level

### 7.4 Performance Considerations

1. **LLM Efficiency**:
   * LLM is only used when absolutely necessary
   * Batches multiple requests to minimize API calls
   * Caches results to avoid duplicate lookups

2. **OpenLibrary Optimization**:
   * Local mirror support for offline operation
   * Falls back to remote API only when needed
   * Requires â‰¥80% title/author match to accept results

3. **Early Termination**:
   * High-confidence matches skip enrichment entirely
   * Low-quality matches are flagged for manual review
   * Blacklisted terms immediately reduce confidence

This system ensures that LLM usage is minimized while still providing high-quality metadata enrichment where needed, with clear visual indicators of confidence levels in the UI.

### Edge-cases & Mitigations (v2.2.0)

#### Anthologies (Multi-author Collections)

* **Issue**: Multiple authors in one folder can cause false negatives
* **Mitigation**: Author mismatch now reduces folder-match weight by 25% (was 50%)
* **Fallback**: File-view mode allows manual correction of any misclassifications

#### Low-bit-rate Audiobooks

* **Issue**: Very efficient encodings (30 MB/hour) could be misclassified
* **Mitigation**: Added duration-based validation (minimum 30 minutes total)
* **Improvement**: File size thresholds adjusted based on total duration

#### Inconsistent Tagging

* **Issue**: Varied or missing metadata affects matching accuracy
* **Mitigation**: Enhanced pattern matching for common chapter formats:

  ```python
  CH_\d+|Ch\.?\s*\d+|Track\s*\d+|Part\s+\d+
  ```

* **Fallback**: Audio content analysis for files with poor metadata

#### Multi-Volume Works

* **Issue**: Books split across multiple volumes (e.g., "Book 1", "Book 2")
* **Mitigation**: Volume detection and special handling for multi-volume series
* **Improvement**: Deduplication of common series prefixes during comparison

#### Non-English Content

* **Issue**: Some algorithms (like Soundex) are English-biased
* **Mitigation**: Added Unicode normalization and language detection
* **Fallback**: Character-based similarity metrics for non-Latin scripts
